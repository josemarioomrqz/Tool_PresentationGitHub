### Confirguration Managment (GitHub)

## Description:

# Task the tool is supposed to accomplish:
GitHub supports configuration management by helping teams store, track, and control changes to code and related project files over time. It enables version control (so changes are recorded and reversible), collaboration through branching and pull requests, and centralized visibility into project history. This helps prevent configuration drift, reduces “it works on my machine” issues, and ensures everyone is working from a consistent, documented baseline.

Specific tool name I will demo:
GitHub (Git + GitHub Pull Requests) — specifically:
	•	Creating a repository and committing changes
	•	Creating a branch for a feature/change
	•	Opening a Pull Request (PR) to review and merge changes into the main branch
	•	Using PR history to trace configuration/code changes

# Configuration Management (GitHub)

## Description
GitHub supports **configuration management** by helping teams store, track, and control changes to code and related project files over time.

It enables:
- **Version control** (changes are recorded and reversible)
- **Collaboration** through branching and pull requests
- **Centralized visibility** into project history

This helps prevent configuration drift, reduces “it works on my machine” issues, and ensures everyone works from a consistent, documented baseline.

## Task the tool is supposed to accomplish
- Maintain a shared **source of truth** for the project (repository)
- Track changes over time (**commits** and history)
- Support parallel development (**branches**)
- Provide controlled integration via review (**pull requests / PRs**)
- Improve traceability (who changed what, when, and why)

## Specific tool name I will demo
**GitHub** (Git + GitHub Pull Requests)

### What I will demonstrate
- Creating a repository and committing changes
- Creating a branch for a feature/change
- Opening a Pull Request (PR) to review and merge changes into the `main` branch
- Using PR/commit history to trace configuration and code changes
